This directory contains face-api.js model files that are needed for facial recognition.

The models should be downloaded from:

Required models:
- tiny_face_detector_model-weights_manifest.json
- tiny_face_detector_model-shard1
- face_landmark_68_model-weights_manifest.json
- face_landmark_68_model-shard1
- face_recognition_model-weights_manifest.json
- face_recognition_model-shard1
- face_recognition_model-shard2

These models will be loaded by the application at runtime.
